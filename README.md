# Variable Arithmetic (C++)

This simple C++ project demonstrates how to use **custom structs**, **function overloading**, and **references** to manipulate values.  
The focus is on basic **arithmetic operations** using a wrapper struct called `variable`.

## Features

- Struct `variable` holds a single `double` value
- Functions for:
  - Adding two variables
  - Incrementing by `1`
  - Incrementing by another variable's value
  - Returning references to enable chaining
